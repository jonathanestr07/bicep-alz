## Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.
Defender for Cloud provides the tools needed to harden your resources, track your security posture, protect against cyber attacks, and streamline security management. Because it's natively integrated, deployment of Defender for Cloud is easy, providing you with simple auto-provisioning to secure your resources by default.

Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs to manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides two broad pillars of cloud security.

- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) - Features such as secure score, detection of security misconfigurations in virtual machines, and asset inventory among other things. These features will strengthen the cloud posture and track compliance with built-in policies.
- Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) - CWP brings a range of additional security features including regulatory standards (such as NIST and Azure CIS). CWP also include vulnerability scanning from Qualys that is included with the Standard edition.
