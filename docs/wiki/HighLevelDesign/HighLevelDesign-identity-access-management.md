## Identity & Access Management Overview

### Role Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the Entra ID security model to perform access control of resources by users on a more granular level. Users specified in RBAC permissions can access and execute actions on the resources within their scope of work. RBAC can limit access to only the specific resources needed rather than the entire subscription.

RBAC is designed to leverage existing Entra ID users and groups or use on-premises Active Directory accounts for access management via synchronization. It is recommended to use Groups with RBAC instead of individual users. In addition to the built-in roles that can be used creating customer RBAC roles that relate to key user personas and consumers of the platform will provide a good starting point to manage permissions across the environment.

### Managed Identities

There are two types of managed identities:

- **System-assigned:** Some Azure services allow you to enable a managed identity directly on a service instance. When creating a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Entra ID. The identity is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance. When the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Entra ID.
- **User-assigned:** You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. For user-assigned managed identities, the identity is managed separately from the resources that use it.

| **Property**                   | **System-assigned managed identity**                                                                                                                                                            | **User-assigned managed identity**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Identity & Access Management Design Decisions

- A modular Role-based Access Control (RBAC) framework will be implemented that includes the Management Groups and Subscriptions hierarchy. Permissions will be inherited from the parent and flow down to the resources below.
- The RBAC framework will align with user personas to encapsulate roles and responsibilities across the platform.
  - Platform level roles will be responsible for key activities across the whole Azure platform.
  - Landing Zone-level roles will be allocated to the appropriate Landing Zone where users would have access to the whole Landing Zone.
- Permissions will be assigned using Microsoft Entra ID security groups that will control access to these resources using associated Entra ID roles.
- Each Entra ID Security Group should have an owner assigned to the group that is accountable for the permissions.
- All user permissions will be controlled by Entra ID Privileged Identity Management.
- Initially there will be four (4) custom roles that will align to roles and define the required permissions, over time this can evolve to include other rules as needed
  - **PlatformOps:** Responsible for management and deployment of control plane resource types such as Subscriptions, Management Groups via IaC and the respective CI/CD pipelines.
  - **NetOps:** Responsible for definition and management of the common networking components in Azure including the hybrid connectivity and firewall resource to control internet facing networking traffic. The NetOps team is responsible to handout virtual networks to landing zone subscriptions.
  - **SecOps:** Responsible for definition and management of Azure Policy and RBAC permissions on the platform for landing zones and platform management groups and subscriptions. Security operations including monitoring and the definition and the operation of reporting and auditing dashboard.
  - **Landing Zone Subscription Owner:** Responsible for definition and management of a Landing Zone, has the same permissions as `Contributor`, except for making changes to core networking resources."
- System Managed Identities will be used by Azure Policy to apply `DeployIfNotExist` actions across the platform.
- There will be Service Connections and associated Service Principals created that Azure DevOps will be use for CI/CD purposes.

> **Rationale:** Defining a modular RBAC framework will assist with the principle of least privileged for accessing resources within Azure
>
> **Implications:** A process will need to be defined for managing RBAC permissions using Entra ID security groups to ensure operational requests meet compliance requirements and agility within the platform

## Identity & Access Management Design

Multiple types of identities will be used across the Azure Platform, these include:

- **Custom Role Definitions-** Custom Roles that will align to responsibilities to provide the specific access to Azure actions.
- **System-Assigned Managed Identities-** Azure Policy will use System-Assigned Managed Identities to manage the lifecycle of `DeployIfNotExist` Azure Policy remediation.
- **Service Connections & Service Principals-** These will work in parallel to provide permissions to deploy resources into Azure programmatically using Azure DevOps pipelines.

### Custom Role Definitions Configuration

A layered approach to RBAC permissions will be implemented using cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID Security Groups. These permissions will be targeted at the associated management group and subscription levels but can also be done at a more granular resource group level if required.

The table below outlines the custom roles that have been created and applied across the environment.

Role assignment to some of these custom roles are applied at different scopes as outlined in the diagram below:

As result of these role assignments, the following Entra AD groups must be created so that can be assigned.
