# Wiki is synchronised with the project repository

This entire wiki is synced from the `/docs/wiki` folder of the project repository. If you wish to make edits, please do so in the project repository.

> **Note:**
>
> Note that GitHub Wikis (aka, Gollum) do not natively support subdirectories. Nested markdown files in subfolders are also brought to the root level of the wiki. As such ensure your naming standards for the files include the subfolder name. E.g. `Pipelines\Overview.md` should be `wiki/Pipelines-Overview.md`

## Notice something wrong or missing?

If you discover any documentation issue or would like to request new content, please raise them as an issue on the repository.
